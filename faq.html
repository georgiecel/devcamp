        <h1>Devcamp 2023 ‚Äì FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Where are we staying?</h2>
        <p>We are staying at <a href="https://huntervalley.vocohotels.com">voco Kirkton Park</a> in Hunter Valley. It will take a little over two hours‚Äô drive from Central Station <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Central+Station+Grand+Concourse,+Eddy+Avenue,+Haymarket+NSW/voco+Kirkton+Park+Hunter+Valley,+an+IHG+Hotel,+336+Oakey+Creek+Rd,+Pokolbin+NSW+2320/@-33.347873,150.708364,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b12ae23d028b11f:0xdd5e5f8ba1a340c2!2m2!1d151.2065646!2d-33.8828592!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b0ccb2244f1235d:0x801b392131f2ade9!2m2!1d151.3056666!2d-32.8085083">according to Google Maps</a>, but can take <strong>three hours</strong> if you are catching the bus (coach) we have booked.</p>
        <h2>Where does the bus leave from?</h2>
        <p>The bus will be departing from Central Station on Wednesday 8 March at 9:00am. Please meet in the Grand Concourse area of the station by 8:30am.</p>
        <h2>When do we get home on Friday if we are catching the bus?</h2>
        <p>We are scheduled to be back at Central Station by 5:00pm on Friday 10 March. We will leave Hunter Valley at 2:00pm, allowing enough time for traffic.</p>
        <h2>Where do I RSVP for the bus?</h2>
        <p>We will send out a survey in early 2023 once the holiday period has subsided. If you are planning to make your own way there, please let us know using that survey as well.</p>
        <h2>I am not in Sydney, how do I get there?</h2>
        <p>You should already be having conversations with your manager about flights to Sydney. The cost of these flights will be covered by the company. If you are not travelling by plane, you may need to discuss travel reimbursement with your manager.</p>
        <h2>Who is coming to Devcamp?</h2>
        <p>Engineering, Operations, Shared Services, Product, and Jason. üòú</p>
        <h2>If I am not attending, do I still have to work?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are expected to work as normal, unless you have some other leave planned.</p>
        <h2>How much downtime will we get?</h2>
        <p>We will have an activity planned on Wednesday afternoon, with potentially a little bit of free time before dinner. Thursday is scheduled to be a ‚Äúconference day‚Äù with talks but regular breaks, and will run from roughly 10:00 to 4:00 (time frame is approximate and subject to change ‚Äì we don‚Äôt want you to burn out). Free time is also scheduled for Friday morning before departure.</p>
        <h2>I want to do a talk at Devcamp!</h2>
        <p>We will send out a survey to collect interest, but in the meantime please speak to your manager and they will let us know you‚Äôre keen!</p>
        <h2>What is the format of the conference day?</h2>
        <p>We are welcoming shorter talks of 10‚Äì20 minutes, rather than previous years of 40 minutes or a couple hours of workshops. This will give more people the opportunity to speak. We area also considering a more spontaneous lightning talks session that requires no preparation.</p>
        <p>Unlike 2020, talks will be single stream ‚Äì there will only be one talk happening at a time ‚Äì so you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù which talk you want to go to.</p>
        <h2>Will talks be recorded?</h2>
        <p>We encourage everyone to come to Devcamp if they can, so that they can listen to talks as they happen. In previous years we recorded talks and had presentation slides stitched into the recording. After reviewing previous years of Devcamp, we found that people got more value out of being present at Devcamp and not from the recordings. So in 2023 we are going with something more basic, inviting speakers to share their slides and having a single camera recording the speaker.</p>
        <h2>I want to help out with Devcamp. üëÄ</h2>
        <p>While we already have an organising team, there is room for additional help during the three days of Devcamp, such as helping gather everyone for the bus, MC-ing, and in general helping us keep things in order. Please reach out to someone from the organising team if you are interested.</p>
        <h2>I am feeling overwhelmed. What do I do? ‚òπÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>Take a break from the sessions or the activities if you need to. You can go for a walk, explore, sit in a quiet corner, go to your room, take a nap, etc. We encourage you to put your mental health first.</p>
        <h2>What should I bring with me to Devcamp?</h2>
        <p>You should bring clothes; pyjamas; toothbrush; toothpaste; your laptop, charger(s), and adapters. You will have enough free time to explore, walk, or run ‚Äì so bring swimming gear and activewear if you feel so inclined. We encourage you to bring board games or other activities that you can use during downtime.</p>
        <h2>Do I need to bring <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Towel">a towel?</a></h2>
        <p>If you want. üòâ</p>
        <h2>I have some other concern that isn‚Äôt here.</h2>
        <p>Send a message to the #devcamp Slack channel and we can add it to this FAQ. If it is a private matter, message one of us: Staples, Chris W, Shenny, Henry, Rashmita, or Georgie.</p>

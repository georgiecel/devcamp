        <h1>Devcamp 2025 ‚Äì FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Are we getting swag?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we will be getting shirts at the very least. Stay tuned for more info!</p>
        <h2>Where are we staying?</h2>
        <p>We are staying at <a href="https://sebelkiama.com.au/">The Sebel</a> in Kiama. It is a 6 minute walk from Kiama train station, and about a 2 hour drive from Sydney CBD. It can take up to 2 hours 30 minutes if there is traffic, or if you don‚Äôt use toll roads, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HZ5DKAV2P7bEk3X39">according to Google Maps</a>.</p>
        <h2>Is transport organised to and from the venue? Is there a bus?</h2>
        <p>There will be <strong>no dedicated bus</strong> this year, due to the train station being a short walk (6 minutes) from the venue.</p>
        <p>A group of us plan to meet at Central Station at 9:00 AM to catch the 9:27 AM train on the South Coast Line (SCO), scheduled to arrive at Kiama train station at 11:39 AM. The fare for one way is approximately $10.33 AUD.</p>
        <h2>If I‚Äôm driving, what time should I arrive?</h2>
        <p>Please arrive at around 12:00 PM on Wednesday 4 June.</p>
<!--         <h2>I am not in Sydney, how do I get there?</h2>
        <p>You should already be having conversations with your manager about flights to Sydney. The cost of these flights will be covered by the company. If you are not travelling by plane, you may need to discuss travel reimbursement with your manager.</p> -->
        <h2>Who is coming to Devcamp?</h2>
        <p>CM Engineering, product managers, and a couple of familiar folks from design, IT and ops. ‚ú®</p>
        <h2>If I am not attending, do I still have to work?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are expected to work as normal, unless you have some other leave planned.</p>
<!--         <h2>Is there internet access?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is, although we can‚Äôt guarantee that it will be stable. If you are a speaker, please try not to rely on an internet connection for your slides or resources.</p>
        <h2>How much downtime will we get?</h2>
        <p>We have tried to allow as much downtime as possible on Wednesday afternoon before dinner, Thursday afternoon before dinner, and Friday morning before the Giving Back event at 11:00 AM. Please, if you need to take more time out, take some time out to rest.</p>
        <h2>Will talks be recorded?</h2>
        <p>We encourage everyone to come to Devcamp if they can, so that they can listen to talks as they happen. In previous years we recorded talks and had presentation slides stitched into the recording. After reviewing previous years of Devcamp, we found that people got more value out of being present at Devcamp and not from the recordings. This year we are leaving this up to the speaker if they would like their talk recorded. We will be using a basic approach of a smartphone recording. As a speaker, you can offer your phone, someone else‚Äôs, or one of the organising team can volunteer theirs.</p> -->
<!--         <h2>I want to help out with Devcamp. üëÄ</h2>
        <p>While we already have an organising team, there is room for additional help during the three days of Devcamp, such as helping gather everyone for the bus, MC-ing, and in general helping us keep things in order. Please reach out to someone from the organising team if you are interested.</p> -->
        <h2>I am feeling overwhelmed. What do I do? ‚òπÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>Take a break from the sessions or the activities if you need to. You can go for a walk, explore, sit in a quiet corner, go to your room, take a nap, etc. We encourage you to put your mental health first.</p>
        <h2>What should I bring with me to Devcamp?</h2>
        <p>You should bring clothes; pyjamas; toothbrush; toothpaste; your laptop, charger(s), and adapters. There will be an activity that requires some light movement, so recommend having some comfortable clothes and shoes. We also encourage you to bring board games or other activities that you can use during downtime.</p>
        <h2>Do I need to bring <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Towel">a towel</a>?</h2>
        <p>If you want. üòâ</p>
        <h2>I have some other concern that isn‚Äôt here.</h2>
        <p>Send a message to the #devcamp Slack channel and we can add it to this FAQ. If it is a private matter, message one of us: Shenny Mackie, Christopher Wright, Henry Soesanto, Rashmita Pinto, Georgie Cooke, Sam Crome, Luke Adlam.</p>
        <p>We also welcome feedback during Devcamp. If something is not working out for you, or something is concerning you, reach out and we will do our best to help. We want to make sure everyone feels safe and has a good time.</p>

        <h1>Devcamp 2024 – Code of Conduct</h1>
        <h2>TL;DR: Be a decent human being.</h2>
        <p>All attendees at Devcamp are required to follow this code of conduct. Although Devcamp is off-site, we still expect everyone to treat each other with respect. We want to ensure that Devcamp is a safe environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof.</p>
        <p>Harassment will not be tolerated. This includes offensive verbal comments, sexual imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography, sustained disruption of talks and events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and advocating for any of the aforementioned behaviour. Sexual and offensive imagery is not appropriate for Devcamp, and this includes any talk or workshop, any social activity at Devcamp, and any social media posts related to Devcamp.</p>
        <p>Attendees asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. We expect attendees to follow this code of conduct in all event spaces as well as any social activities that occur during Devcamp.</p>
        <p>If an attendee engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expelling the offender from Devcamp.</p>
        <h2>Photos</h2>
        <p>We assume that most attendees will be OK with having photos taken of them, but if in doubt, please ask. However, definitely ask people you are taking photos of, or who are included in photos, if you will be posting the photo publicly, e.g. on social media.</p>
        <h2>Inclusive language</h2>
        <p>Avoid using words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “lame”, or “retarded” – these are examples of ableist language that devalue people who have physical or mental disabilities. This often does not stem from any desire to offend, but from what we perceive to be “normal”. These words can be avoided by using clearer descriptions of what we intend to communicate. To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read <a href="https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html">this guide</a>.</p>
        <p>Avoid using terms like “dude” or “guys” to address a group of people. Use generic terms to ensure everyone is included. Instead of using “hi guys”, you can simply say “hi”; or use “folks”, or “everyone”. <a href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Nonsexist_language">More information on nonsexist language</a>.</p>

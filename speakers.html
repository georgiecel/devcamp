        <h1>Devcamp 2025 🎤 Speaker pack</h1>
        <h2>HEY ‼️</h2>
        <h2>I see you!</h2>
        <h2>I know you are looking at this and panicking about your talk. 😳</h2>
        <h2>You have this under the control. We’ve seen you put in the hard work. You are unstoppable! 🔥💞</h2>
        <p>OK, now for the summary of the deets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🎤 Two handheld microphones, so you don’t have to keep passing your mic to the MC or audience if you are taking questions</li>
            <li>🧍 There is a podium/lectern*</li>
            <li>📺 Aspect ratio of the presentation screen is <strong>16:9</strong></li>
            <li>🔌 Connection is <strong>HDMI</strong>; we will have a couple of USB-C-to-HDMI dongles</li>
            <li>💻 You can present from your own laptop</li>
            <li>🌞 On Wednesday, test your setup from 12:30 PM (lunch time), and on Thursday, from 8:00 AM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*If you think you might need someone to hold a microphone for you for a few slides, or for potential height restrictions on the lectern, let us know ahead of time.</p>
        <h2>On the day</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔋 Make sure your laptop is charged adquately before your scheduled presentation time</li>
            <li>⌚️ Come to the conference room Wednesday 12:30–1:30 PM or Thursday 8:00–9:00 AM to test your setup (strongly recommend doing this) or during any of the breaks</li>
            <li>🟢 Be ready to plug in when the person scheduled before you is doing their presentation</li>
            <li>🎤 While the audience is settling, let the MC know of anything you want them to say in your intro</li>
            <li>🎥 <strong>Your talk will be recorded</strong>. It will just be you and the presentation screen in frame. Tell us if you don’t want it recorded.</li>
            <li>🛎️ If you want a timing warning, you can choose between an audible bell, or a silent one (1 min left, and time’s up). Silent warnings will be in the form of a paper sign held up by the person handling video recording.</li>
            <li>❓ You can accept questions from the audience at the end of your session, if there is enough time. Before you start, let the MC know your preference, especially if you would rather not answer questions immediately after your talk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Helpful tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🛜 Internet connection can be poor, so make sure you’ve got a local copy of anything you need for demos.</li>
            <li>🔊 Consider a video recording for demos. We’ll aim to make sure the sound works, but be prepared to speak to the video in real time if it doesn’t work out.</li>
            <li>💬 Please repeat any questions from the audience into the microphone or adequately describe your slides verbally for people who may not be able to see clearly.</li>
            <li>💗 Feeling nervous? Some star jumps, going for a walk, or some movement before your talk can help. One thing you can try is to shake each of your limbs 8 times, then repeat but shake them 4 times, then 2, then 1. Making some funny faces can also help relax the jaw.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Backup plan</h2>
        <p>Only in the event of a crisis! Don’t panic—if something goes wrong, we’ll take our time and work through it, even if it means running a little late or last minute adjustments 😊</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save a PDF version of your slides in case your presentation software fails to work</li>
            <li>Upload this somewhere online as well: email it to yourself, upload it to Slack, etc. so that it may be accessed by someone else somewhere (we usually have a Google Drive, but we were a bit slow this year! 🫣)</li>
            <li>We can try to load the slides from an organiser’s computer. It is likely to be a MacBook</li>
            <li>You will do the presentation from someone else’s laptop, but we will allow a couple of minutes beforehand to familiarise yourself with the setup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>💕 We really appreciate your hard work and dedication. A lot of time goes into preparing a talk, and people don’t often realise that. Thank you so much for making this Devcamp what it is!</li>
        </ul>

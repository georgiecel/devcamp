        <h1>Devcamp 2024 🎤 Speaker pack</h1>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎤 Two microphones: a handheld, and one attached to a lectern.*</li>
            <li>📺 Aspect ratio of the presentation screen is <strong>16:9</strong></li>
            <li>🔌 Connection is <strong>HDMI</strong>; we will have a couple of USB-C-to-HDMI dongles</li>
            <li>💻 You can present from your own laptop</li>
            <li>🎛️ We will have a clicker available if you need it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*If you think you might need someone to hold a microphone for you for a few slides, or for potential height restrictions on the lectern, let us know ahead of time.</p>
        <h2>On the day</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🔋 Make sure your laptop is charged adquately before your scheduled presentation time</li>
            <li>⌚️ Come to the conference room between 8:00 AM and 8:45 AM on the day to test your setup (strongly recommend doing this) or in the lunch break</li>
            <li>🟢 Be ready to plug in when the person scheduled before you is doing their presentation</li>
            <li>🎤 While the audience is settling, give the person MC-ing you a brief intro to introduce you to the audience. The MC will likely be one of the Devcamp organisers</li>
            <li>🎥 Your talk will be recorded. It will just be you and the presentation screen in frame. Tell us if you don’t want it recorded.</li>
            <li>🛎️ A bell will be used for timing warning (5 mins left, 1 min, time’s up). Tell us if you prefer a silent warning. This will be in the form of a paper sign held up by the person handling video recording.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Helpful tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🛜 Internet connection can be poor, so make sure you’ve got a local copy of anything you need for demos.</li>
            <li>🔊 Consider a video recording for demos. We’ll aim to make sure the sound works, but be prepared to speak to the video in real time if it doesn’t work out.</li>
            <li>💬 Please repeat any questions from the audience into the microphone or adequately describe your slides verbally for people who may not be able to see clearly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Backup plan</h2>
        <p>Only in the event of a crisis! Don’t panic—if something goes wrong, we’ll take our time and work through it, even if it means running a little late or last minute adjustments 😊</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please upload your completed slides to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DGN5C5FR1x6e0m0CRcstltLOvBqqssJ_?usp=sharing">this Google Drive</a>, ideally by the morning of Tuesday 11 June</li>
            <li>We will load the slides from an organiser’s computer. It is likely to be a MacBook</li>
            <li>You will do the presentation from someone else’s laptop, but we will allow a couple of minutes beforehand to familiarise yourself with the setup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>💕 We really appreciate your hard work and dedication. A lot of time goes into preparing a talk, and people don’t often realise that. Thank you so much for making this Devcamp what it is!</li>
            <li>🛝 Please share a PDF copy of your slides in the same <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DGN5C5FR1x6e0m0CRcstltLOvBqqssJ_?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a> as the backups so that attendees can have a look at them later (we can remove the backup PowerPoint/Keynote/etc. files later). You can also share them in the #devcamp Slack channel if you want.</li>
        </ul>

I will then breeze through each of the current services, with emphasis on how their principles (and maybe even their implementation!) are actually reusable for other applications. There will be an emphasis on our approach to the problem of breaking a monolith apart in general as well as the general abstraction each service represents, so it is applicable to event-driven applications in general and not just that particular former monolith. The whole discussion will be grounded on why we needed to do this, as opposed to ‚Äúwe wanted to do microservices because monoliths are baaad.‚Äù</p>
